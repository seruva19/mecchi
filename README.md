# Mecchi

## Vision

Mecchi is an attempt to build an AI-powered node-based web audio editor with the long-term goal of evolving into a full-featured modular DAW designed for creating generative music content 😀

## Status

But for now, it's just a POC and not yet production-ready or close to being a mature product 🙄

## Credits 

It is built on [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), [AudioLDM 2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ReactFlow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and other great projects 🔥

## Short-term plans
