# Mecchi

## Vision

Mecchi is an attempt to build an AI-powered node-based web audio editor with the long-term goal of evolving into a full-featured modular open-source DAW designed for creating generative music content 😀

## Status

But for now, it's just a POC and not yet production-ready or close to being a mature product 🙄

## Credits 

It is built on [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), [AudioLDM 2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ReactFlow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and other great projects 🔥

## List of nodes

TODO

## Short-term plans

* Generalisation of the node UI
* Parametric (config-based) nodes
* Training

## Pipelines

* TTA (text-to-audio) - **implemented**
* ATA (audio-to-audio) - pending
* ADU (audio-data-upsampling, "sound upscaling") - **implemented**
* ADC (audio-data-completion, "sound inpainting") - pending
* AST (audio-style-transfer) - pending
* ADB (audio-data-blending) - pending

## How it looks? 

Nothing fancy yet 🐥 But here is screenshot anyway:
