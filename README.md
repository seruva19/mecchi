# Mecchi

## Vision

Mecchi is an attempt to build an AI-powered node-based web audio editor with the long-term goal of evolving into a full-featured modular open-source DAW designed for creating generative music content üòÄ

## Status

But for now, it's <b>WIP POC</b> and not yet production-ready or close to being a mature product üôÑ

## Credits 

It is built on [Stable Audio Open](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-1.0), [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), [AudioLDM 2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ReactFlow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and other great projects üî•

## Short-term plans

* <b>Workflows save/load</b>

## How it looks? 

Nothing fancy yet üê• But here is screenshot anyway:

## Usage

Requires Python + Git + Node.js.  
To install, clone repository and run:

## Documentation

One day üòè  
OK, just need more time. Noone uses this, so it's OK to not have docs üôÇ
