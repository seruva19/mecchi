# Mecchi

## Vision

Mecchi is an attempt to build an AI-powered node-based web audio editor with the long-term goal of evolving into a full-featured modular open-source DAW designed for creating generative music content üòÄ

## Status

But for now, it's just a POC and not yet production-ready or close to being a mature product üôÑ

## Credits 

It is built on [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), [AudioLDM 2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ReactFlow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and other great projects üî•

## Short-term plans

* Workflows save/load
* Generalisation of the node UI
* Parametric nodes
* Config-based nodes (.py) 
* Audiogen
* MAGNeT
* Demucs
* Whisper
* Auffusion
* Musicgen training

## Pipelines

- [x] TTA (text-to-audio)  
- [ ] ATA (audio-to-audio)    
- [x] ADU (audio-data-upsampling, "audio upscaling")  
- [ ] ADI (audio-data-interpolation, "audio inpainting")  
- [ ] ADC (audio-data-completion, "audio outpainting")  
- [ ] AST (audio-style-transfer)   
- [ ] ADB (audio-data-blending)  
- [ ] ADS (audio-data-separation)  
- [ ] ATT (audio-to-text, "audio interrogation")  
- [ ] ITA (image-to-audio)  
- [ ] VTA (video-to-audio)
