# Mecchi

## Vision

Mecchi is an attempt to build an AI-powered node-based web audio editor with the long-term goal of evolving into a full-featured modular open-source DAW designed for creating generative music content üòÄ

## Status

But for now, it's <b>WIP POC</b> and not yet production-ready or close to being a mature product üôÑ

## Credits 

It is built on [Audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft), [AudioLDM 2](https://github.com/haoheliu/AudioLDM2), [AudioSR](https://github.com/haoheliu/versatile_audio_super_resolution), [Bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark), [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [ReactFlow](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow), [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) and other great projects üî•

## Short-term plans

* Workflows save/load
* Generalisation of the node UI
* Parametric nodes
* Config-based nodes (.py) 
* Audiogen
* Enhanced MusicGen nodes
* MAGNeT
* Demucs
* EnCLAP
* Auffusion
* Musicgen training
* StableAudio 2
* Navigation between node groups
